This is a re-roll of [v1].

Previous versions:

[v1] http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.git/269249

This patch series is based on pt/pull-tests.

While parsing the command-line arguments, git-pull stops parsing at the
first unrecognized option, assuming that any subsequent options are for
git-fetch, and can thus be kept in the shell's positional parameters
list, so that it can be passed to git-fetch via the expansion of "$ <at>
".

However, certain functions in git-pull assume that the positional
parameters do not contain any options. Fix this by making git-pull
handle git-fetch's options as well at the option parsing stage.

With this change in place, we can move on to migrate git-pull to use
git-rev-parse --parseopt such that its option parsing is consistent with
the other git commands.

I believe this is the last required behavior change for my rewrite of
git-pull.sh to C.

v2

* Initialize variables to prevent them from being set in the command
  line.

* Update the documentation as well.
