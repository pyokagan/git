v2

* enum rebase_type gained a new value REBASE_INVALID = -1 to represent
  invalid values passed to --rebase. We can't immediately die() on
  invalid values because we need parse_options() to show the git-pull
  usage as well.

* parse_config_rebase() now returns an enum rebase_type to make it clear
  what kind of value it returns.

* parse_config_rebase() now does not depend on git_config_maybe_bool()
  returning 1 for true and 0 for false. If it returns 0, it is
  REBASE_FALSE. If it returns any true value >=0, it is interpreted as
  REBASE_TRUE.

* get_merge_branch_1() has been renamed to get_upstream_branch() to be
  consistent with the similar get_upstream_branch() in sha1_name.c.

* get_merge_branch_2() has been renamed to get_tracking_branch() to
  indicate what it is doing: deriving the remote tracking branch from
  the refspec.

* Various small variable re-names and docstring tweaks. Hopefully
* everything reads better now.
