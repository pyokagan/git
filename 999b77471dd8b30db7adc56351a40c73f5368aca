v2

* Previously, config_get_rebase() attempted to do too many things. It:

  1. Checked if there was a configuration for
     branch.$curr_branch.rebase, and if not, then pull.rebase

  2. Parsed the configuration value and died if the value is invalid.

  These 2 functions have been split into config_get_rebase_default() and
  config_get_rebase() respectively.
